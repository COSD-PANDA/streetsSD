## Welcome!
This map highlights city streets that have been repaired since July 1, 2013 and are currently scheduled for repair over the next several years.  Depending on which layer is showing, streets are colored by type of repair or by their score in the 2011 Overall Condition Index (OCI) survey conducted by the City.

You can use the menu in the upper left to filter street repairs by year, to display each city street’s OCI, show upcoming work, and to track the progress of Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s pledge to complete 1,000 miles of street repairs in five years.  You may also click on an individual street to see additional detailed information.

The data in this map is the latest and most accurate available from the <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/stormwater" target="_blank" title="San Diego Transportation and Storm Water Department">City's Transportation & Storm Water Department</a>. It will be updated quarterly.


## Overview of City Street Network
As of 2015, the City of San Diego’s street network consists of about 2,800 miles of streets as measured along their center-lines, the majority of which are asphalt streets. The City uses center-line miles to describe the distance of our street network. “Lane-miles” are used to describe repair work and account for both the length and width of our streets. Totals for miles paved are in lane miles.

## Condition of City streets
</span>

A 100-point OCI rating system the City uses classifies streets into one of three categories:

<span id="condition-good">
**Good** - A street in this category has little or no cracking, minor potholes, or other distresses; has excellent drivability; and does not need maintenance. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.
</span>

<span id="condition-fair">**Fair** - A street in this category has moderate cracking and/or some minor potholes; has adequate drivability; and is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal or a minor asphalt overlay, which may include remedial repairs. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.</span>


<span id="condition-poor">**Poor** - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, exhibits a rough ride, and qualifies for a comprehensive asphalt overlay or a total reconstruction – meaning that a street may be replaced from the ground up if conditions warrant that effort. A street in poor condition has an OCI rating between 0 and 39.</span>

## Types of street repair
</span>

<span id="street-rep-asphalt">
**Asphalt Resurfacing** - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1 to 3 inches over an old worn-out street surface or by first removing 2 to 3 inches of existing asphalt before a new layer is placed.
</span>

<span id="street-rep-concrete">**Concrete Street** - Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels and complete reconstruction of the entire roadway when warranted.</span>

<span id="street-rep-slurry">**Slurry Seal** - Slurry sealing repair uses a mixture of sand and an emulsion of petroleum products to coat a street surface up to 3/8 of an inch think. A slurry seal coating is not a complete resurfacing treatment and is used to preserve and prolong the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and small surface repairs may be conducted before the sealing effort.</span>
