##About this map
This map highlights city streets that have been repaired since September 2012. Depending on which layer is showing, streets are colored by type of repair or by their ranking in the 2011 Overall Condition Index (OCI) survey conducted by the City.
You can use the menu in the upper left to filter street repairs by year, to display each city street’s OCI, show upcoming work, and to track the progress of Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s pledge to complete 1,000 miles of street repairs in five years.
The data used to develop this map is the latest available from the City’s Transportation & Storm Water Department. Numbers shown here may have been updated from previous reports on street repairs. Streets that do not have an OCI listed are not City-maintained streets and are typically located on a private property or a military base.

## Overview of City Street Network
As of 2015, the City of San Diego’s street network consists of about 2,800 miles of streets as measured along their center-lines. This includes 2,659 miles of asphalt streets, 115 miles of concrete streets, and 203 miles of paved alleys. The City uses center-line miles to describe the distance of our street network. “Lane-miles” are used to describe repair work and account for both the length and width of our streets. Totals for miles paved are in lane miles.

## Condition of City streets
</span>

The 100 point OCI ranking system developed by the City classifies streets into one of three categories:

<span id="condition-good">
**Good** - A street in this category has little or no cracking, potholes, or other distresses; has excellent drivability; and does not need maintenance. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.
</span>

<span id="condition-fair">**Fair** - A street in this category has moderate cracking and/or some minor potholes; has adequate drivability; and is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal or a minor asphalt overlay, which may include remedial repairs. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.</span>


<span id="condition-poor">**Poor** - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, exhibits a rough ride, and qualifies for a comprehensive asphalt overlay or a total reconstruction – meaning that a street may be replaced from the ground up if conditions warrant that effort. A street in poor condition has an OCI rating between 0 and 39.</span>

## Types of street repair
</span>

<span id="street-rep-asphalt">
**Asphalt Resurfacing** - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1 to 3 inches over an old worn-out street surface.
</span>

<span id="street-rep-concrete">**Concrete Street** - Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels and complete reconstruction of the entire roadway when warranted.</span>

<span id="street-rep-slurry">**Slurry Seal** - Slurry sealing repair uses a mixture of sand and an emulsion of petroleum products to coat a street surface up to 3/8 of an inch thick, sometimes even thiner. A slurry seal coating is not a complete resurfacing treatment and is used to just preserve the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and occasional small surface repairs may be conducted prior to the sealing effort.</span>
