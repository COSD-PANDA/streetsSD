## Condition of City Streets
</span>

<span id="condition-good">
**Good** - A street in the good condition category has little or no cracking, potholes, or other distresses, has excellent drivability, and does not need maintenance. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.
</span>

<span id="condition-fair">**Fair** - A street in the fair condition category has moderate cracking, some minor potholes, has adequate drivability, and is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal, or a minor asphalt overlay which may include remedial repairs. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.</span>

<span id="condition-poor">**Poor** - A street in the poor condition category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, exhibits a rough ride and qualifies for a comprehensive asphalt overlay or a total reconstruction. A street in poor condition has an OCI rating between 0 and 39.</span>

## Types of Street Repair
</span>

<span id="street-rep-asphalt">
**Asphalt Resurfacing** - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1 to 3 inches over an old worn out street surface.
</span>

<span id="street-rep-concrete">**Concrete Street** - Unlike asphalt, concrete streets cannot be resurfaced and need to be completely reconstructed. Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels or complete reconstruction of the entire roadway. Large scale concrete pavement replacement is contracted out to private companies.</span>

<span id="street-rep-slurry">**Slurry Seal** - Slurry Sealing is a seal coat treatment which consists of sand, emulsion, and water applied in a thin layer up to a 3/8 of an inch thick across the street surface. A slurry seal coating is used to preserve the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and occasional surface repairs can be recommended by pavement specialists prior to sealing.</span>
