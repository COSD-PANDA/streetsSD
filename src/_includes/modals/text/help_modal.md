## About this map
This map highlights city streets that have been repaired since 2013. Depending on which layer is showing, streets are colored by type of repair or by their 2011 Overall Condition Index.

Use the menu in the upper left to filter street repairs by year, display each city street’s OCI, show upcoming work, and track the progress of Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s pledge to complete 1,000 miles of street repairs in five years.

The data behind this map is the latest available from the City’s transportation department. Numbers shown here may have been updated from previous reports on street repairs. Streets that do not have an OCI are not City-maintained streets, such as those located on a private property or a military base.

## Condition of City streets
</span>

<span id="condition-good">
**Good** - A street in this category has little or no cracking, potholes, or other distresses; has excellent drivability; and does not need maintenance. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.
</span>

<span id="condition-fair">**Fair** - A street in this category has moderate cracking and/or some minor potholes; has adequate drivability; and is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal or a minor asphalt overlay, which may include remedial repairs. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.</span>

<span id="condition-poor">**Poor** - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, exhibits a rough ride, and qualifies for a comprehensive asphalt overlay or a total reconstruction. A street in poor condition has an OCI rating between 0 and 39.</span>

## Types of street repair
</span>

<span id="street-rep-asphalt">
**Asphalt Resurfacing** - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1 to 3 inches over an old worn-out street surface.
</span>

<span id="street-rep-concrete">**Concrete Street** - Unlike asphalt, concrete streets cannot be resurfaced and need to be completely reconstructed. Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels and complete reconstruction of the entire roadway. Large-scale concrete pavement replacement is contracted out to private companies.</span>

<span id="street-rep-slurry">**Slurry Seal** - Slurry sealing is a seal coat treatment which consists of sand, emulsion, and water applied in a thin layer across the street surface up to 3/8 of an inch thick. A slurry seal coating is used to preserve the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and occasional surface repairs can be recommended by pavement specialists prior to sealing.</span>
